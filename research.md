### LiDAR-Informed, Terrain-Adaptive Invariant Kalman Filtering for Legged Robots
**Authors:** Saaketh Reddy, Ziwon Yoon  
**Status:** In Progress

This paper presents a terrain-aware invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) that adapts its covariance online using LiDAR-derived terrain information. A neural network maps geometric and structural terrain cues to context-dependent uncertainty adjustments, allowing the estimator to modulate trust in kinematic odometry under varying contact and slip conditions for legged robots.

**Abstract:**  
This work studies time-varying underwater sonar returns to extract object and seafloor characteristics relevant to mine countermeasures. It compares several time-frequency representations (STFT, smoothed pseudo Wigner–Ville, empirical wavelet, and chirplet transforms) using spectral concentration and resolution metrics. The impact of optimized transforms is evaluated through time-frequency spectral descriptors.

**Keywords:** Keywords: underwater sonar, time-frequency analysis, spectral concentration, mine countermeasures
